# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project is my first end-to-end machine learning project. It is designed for predicting the presence or absence of heart disease in individuals using a variety of health-related features. The goal is to provide a tool for early detection and risk assessment of heart disease.

## Data Overview

We begin by exploring and analyzing the dataset, gaining insights into the relationships between different health indicators and heart disease.


## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you will need to clone this repository to your local machine. You can do so using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SrikarVeluvali/Heart-Disease-Prediction-ML.git

```

## Running the Code

For running the code, we recommend using Jupyter Notebook for running the provided notebooks. You can install Jupyter Notebook using the following:

```bash
pip install jupyter
```

Once installed, you can open a notebook by running:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

## Model Evaluation

We have trained a machine learning model to predict heart disease. Model evaluation includes various metrics, such as accuracy, a confusion matrix, and a classification report, to assess its performance.

## User-Friendly Interface

An interactive feature has been added to this project, allowing users to input their health data and receive a prediction regarding their risk of heart disease.

## Disclaimer

While this project provides valuable insights and predictions, it is not a substitute for professional medical advice. For personalized medical guidance, it is essential to consult healthcare professionals.

## Acknowledgments

We acknowledge and thank the open-source community, data providers, and healthcare professionals whose work has made this project possible.
